## üèÜ Features

### Search packages online (like [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/))

You are able to search through packages from NPM and it will display them in the
tabulated list.

### Auto detect workspace

Client will automatically detect the existing `globally` and `locally` installed
packages.

### `Install`/`Uninstall`/`Update` packages visiaully

This package visually displays packages by any actions like `install`,
`uninstall`, `update`, etc.

* <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>i</kbd> - Mark package for installation.
* <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>d</kbd> - Mark package for deletion.
* <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>x</kbd> - Execute all marked packages.
* <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>u</kbd> - Update all existing packages.

## üîß Usage

Simply call the command `npm-pkgs` through `M-x` like this.

```
M-x npm-pkgs
```

Basically, you can call this command anywhere in the directory.
But it will probably only show the global packages without the
project definition.
